## Overview
Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Data from two csv files was provided (city_data.csv and ride_data.csv).The task was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph using Pandas and Matplotlib that shows the total weekly fares for each city during a period in 2019. The graph revealed insights on the different cities which are summarized in this report. 
## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
